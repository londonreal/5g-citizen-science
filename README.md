# 5G Citizen Science

Let's see what science says?

Celebrating **FREE SPEECH** and **HUMAN RIGHTS**

To my knowledge there were no independent research studies focused on the safety of 5G.

Recent interview on London Real with David Icke that was taken down by YouTube highlights the necessity of independent research focused on the safety.

- Simple experiment.
- Basic science.
- Controlled conditions.

Let's see what happens.

### Cost breakdown (circa $10k)

- 5G phones: $4,000
- Cheap laptops for streaming: $1000
- Autopsy research: $3,000
- Lab rats: $500
- Cages: $500
- Food: $100
- Travel: $1,000
- Cables, batteries, power adapters, misc: $1000

### Fundraising in ETH

**DON'T TRUST, VERIFY**

Crytocurrencies are censorthip-resistant.

### Experiment design
Simple, measurable, quantifiable experiment.

#### 5G
* 10x celltower locations, 2 cages (for reproducibility) with 1 rat each  
* 5G phone live-streaming 

#### not-5G
* 10x non-celltower locations, 2 cages (for reproducibility) with 1 rat each  
* Laptop connected to via ethernet cable live-streaming 


#### 5G and not-5G have all variables the same
* Live-streaming so that it is easily to verify the rats conditions are the same
* Because celltower bases are some dark buildings, the not-5G locations should be also dark (think attic, no direct sunlight)
* Give rats food, water, activities in the cages, but no human interaction
* Food and water delivered once per day.
* Fresh hay every 3 days
* No black magic spells, just pure science.
* You can send good vibes to higher intelligence and collective consciosuness 

#### Consciousness of neutrality
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto
> human consciousness has an effect on the molecular structure of water

The analysis of the data will be in a double-blind pattern, the live stream will not have any identifiable data, whether the rats are in the 5G or not-5G location.

### Metrics:
* Activity (apply computer vision AI machine learning to determine)
* Appetite
* Lifespan
* Fertility (unsure about that one, loads of effort ensuring pregnancy, maybe in phase II)
* Size of tumors
* ...
* Any other metric that is measurable, quantifable

### Which flavour of lab rats?
I’ve never been in the business of rat testing. Apparently they are standardized and you can buy them:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat
* https://larc.ucsf.edu/sites/larc.ucsf.edu/files/wysiwyg/Charles%20River%202015.pdf

I'm morally OK for these rats to have life in a well designed cage. Their life will not be sacrificed, they are serving higher purpose. Every donation above $200 - you can name your rat! And upon autopsy we will send you the body - if that is legal in your jurisdiction

### One of the many opinions

**US Congress, Senator Blumenthal**

https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/at-senate-commerce-hearing-blumenthal-raises-concerns-on-5g-wireless-technologys-potential-health-risks

> At the end of the exchange, Blumenthal concluded, “So there really is no research ongoing.  We’re kind of flying blind here, as far as health and safety is concerned.”

- Everyone can have an opinion. 
- I'm on the side of love, truth, fact, reality. 
- I believe in gravity ⚡️⚡️⚡️
