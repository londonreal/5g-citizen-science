# 5G Citizen Science

Let's see what is the truth.

Celebrating **FREE SPEECH** and **HUMAN RIGHTS**

To my knowledge there were no independent research studies focused on the safety of 5G.

Recent interview on London Real with David Icke that was taken down by YouTube highlights the necessity of independent research focused on the safety of 5G.

- Simple experiment.
- Basic science.
- Controlled conditions.

Let's see what happens.

### Cost breakdown ($10k)

- 5G phones: $4,000
- Autopsy research: $3,000
- Lab rats: $500
- Cages: $500
- Food: $100
- Travel: $1,000
- Misc$: 700
- Cables, batteries, power adapters: $200

Experiment design
Simple, measurable, quantifiable experiment.
5G
10x celltower locations, 3x rat in individual cages
5G phone live-streaming 
not-5G
10x non-celltower locations, 3x rat in individual cages
Laptop connected to via Ethernet cable live-streaming 

Live-streaming so that it is easily to verify the rats conditions are the same

5G and not-5G have all variables the same.
Give rats food, water, activities…
Food and water delivered once per day.
Fresh hay every 3 days
No human interactions, no black magic spells, just pure science.
Metrics:
Activity (apply computer vision AI machine learning to determine)
Appetite
Lifespan
Size of tumor
....
Any other metric that is measurable, quantifable

I really wish there are no statistical differences.

There is no harm trying.


### Lab rats
I’ve never been in the business of rat testing. Apparently they are standardized and you can buy them:

### One of the many opinions

US Congress, Senator Blumenthal

> At the end of the exchange, Blumenthal concluded, “So there really is no research ongoing.  We’re kind of flying blind here, as far as health and safety is concerned.”

Everyone can have an opinion. I'm on the side of love, truth, fact, reality. I believe in gravity ⚡️⚡️⚡️
